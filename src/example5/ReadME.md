# Dependency Inversion Principle
The principle states that we must use abstraction (abstract classes and interfaces) instead of concrete implementations. High-level modules should not depend on the low-level module but both should depend on the abstraction.

The Dependency Inversion and Open Closed Principles are related, and we can see this being applied in the Open-Closed Principle.

We want our classes to be open to extension, so we have reorganized our dependencies to depend on interfaces instead of concrete classes.
